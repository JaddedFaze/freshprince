  <h1><b>Where I'm From</b></h1>
  <p>I’m from the UK - Middlesex, specifically - Uxbridge, even more specifically. I love the short commute to London and the feel of the country at the same time. I know we dont have a footbal team , so I support Arsenal FC (UP Gunners). I have lost most
    of my so called british accent , but a few people still figure it out. I have a BSC in Mathematics, so logic comes easy to me but front-end programming is a different ball game, and that where I need some help.</p>
